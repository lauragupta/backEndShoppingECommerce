## Description  

This project uses Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to manage a database.  It uses MySQL and Sequalize to create a database and tables and also to edit that information including getting (get), adding (post), editing (put), and deleting. Because this is a back-end project, it does not have a live site. Check out my walkthrough video below to see how I use Insomnia to show my restful routes and to modify the data in the database.
